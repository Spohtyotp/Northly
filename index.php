                <h2>First, let's prepare for the cold Finnish winter weather.</h2>
                <br><br>
                    <p> <h3>Dress in layers - the right way </h3>
                        Thermal base layer (wool or synthetic underwear + leggings) → thick sweater/fleece → waterproof/windproof 
                        winter jacket + snow pants → warm boots with good grip, thick wool socks, mittens, hat, and scarf. No shortcuts — cold bites hard!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><h3>Get proper winter boots and grip</h3>
                        Insulated, waterproof boots are a must (snow and ice are slippery). Add ice grips or choose 
                        boots with thick soles. Indoors get super warm, so easy to remove layers.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><h3>Protect your face, hands & lips</h3>
                        Use thick mittens (better than gloves), cover your face with a scarf or neck gaiter on windy days.
                        Bring strong lip balm and face cream — the dry cold air cracks skin fast.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><h3>Pack for darkness & battery drain</h3>
                        Days are short (sun up only ~6-8 hours). Bring a power bank (cold kills phone batteries quickly), sunglasses (snow glare), 
                        and a headlamp if going far north. Reflector clip helps for walking in the dark.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><h3>Embrace sauna & stay hydrated</h3>
                        Bring a swimsuit — almost every place has a sauna to warm up! Drink lots of water 
                        (you dehydrate fast in cold dry air). Book winter activities (northern lights, husky, etc.) early — February is peak season.</p>

                    <h2>Here are the 5 essential preparation tips for visiting the Netherlands</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p><h3>Layer up smartly for changeable weather</h3>
                        Base layer: Thermal top + leggings (wool/synthetic — not cotton). Mid: Sweater or fleece. Outer: Waterproof/windproof jacket with hood
                        (essential for rain and wind — forget umbrellas, they flip!). Add scarf, gloves, and hat. Indoors (cafés, museums, trains) are overheated, so easy-to-remove layers are key.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><h2>Get waterproof, grippy footwear</h2>
                        Waterproof boots or sturdy walking shoes with good traction — streets get slushy, icy, or puddly. 
                        No regular sneakers; you'll get wet feet fast. Comfortable for lots of walking/cycling (Dutch cities are very walkable/bike-friendly even in winter).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><h2>Protect against wind, rain, and dryness</h2>
                        Windchill is common near the coast — cover ears/neck with scarf or neck gaiter. Bring lip balm, hand cream, and face moisturizer
                         (cold + wind dries skin quickly). Gloves (waterproof if possible) are a must for cold hands.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><h2>Pack for short days and wet conditions</h2>
                        Days are short (~9 hours daylight), often overcast. Bring a small umbrella or rain poncho as backup, power bank (cold drains batteries),
                        and sunglasses (for rare sunny moments or glare off wet surfaces). Reflector or bright clothes help visibility in dim evenings.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><h2>Embrace cozy Dutch vibes & stay practical</h2>
                        No saunas everywhere like Finland, but warm up with hot chocolate, stroopwafels, or indoor spots (museums like Rijksmuseum/Van Gogh are perfect for rainy days). 
                        Drink water (you still dehydrate in cold). Use public transport/OV-chipkaart app — efficient and heated. Book tickets for popular sites early (fewer crowds in winter!).</p>
